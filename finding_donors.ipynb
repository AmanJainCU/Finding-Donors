    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to plot a histogram of these two features. Note the range of the values present and how they are distributed."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: ** Below are the three supervised learning methods that I believe are appropraite for this problem: GaussianNB, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ## GaussianNB\n",
    "\n",
    "Application : Categorizing news, email spam detection, face recognition, sentiment analysis, medical diagnosis, digit recognition and weather prediction.\n",
    " \n",
    "Strengths : Super simple, we are just doing a bunch of counts. If the NB conditional independence assumption actually holds, a Naive Bayes classifier will converge quicker than discriminative models like logistic regression, so we need less training data. And even if the NB assumption doesn't hold, a NB classifier still often performs surprisingly well in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses : Naive Bayes classifier makes a very strong assumption on the shape of your data distribution, i.e. any two features are independent given the output class. Also, risk of a high bias exists when there is small amount of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Candidacy : Since we're trying to categorize individuals into two income groups which are mutually exclusive, NB's algorithm is a good candidate. \n",
    "Ref(https://www.quora.com/In-what-real-world-applications-is-Naive-Bayes-classifier-used)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- ## Gradient Boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "Application : The commercial web search engines Yahoo and Yandex use variants of gradient boosting in their machine-learned ranking engines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths : GBTs build trees one at a time, where each new tree helps to correct errors made by previously trained tree. With each tree added, the model becomes even more expressive. Hence, GBMs provide better results in terms of accuracy and generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses : GBTs training generally takes longer because of the fact that trees are built sequentially. Although it may seem GBDTs are better than random forests, GBDTs are prone to overfitting.We also need to find proper stopping point and it requires several hyper-parameters for tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Candidacy : Since the current data set seem to be imbalanced i.e. there are more examples belonging to a specific class than the other class, ensemble methods i.e. Gradient Boosted trees can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ref(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting#Usage)\n",
    "(https://bmcproc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1753-6561-5-S3-S11)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- ## Support Vector Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "Application : Some common applications of SVM are Face Detection, Text and Hypertext categorization, Bioinformatics, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths : Firstly it has a regularisation parameter, which helps us in avoiding over-fitting. Secondly it uses the kernel trick, so you can build in expert knowledge about the problem by engineering the kernel. \n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses : Choosing the right kernel is a major problem. This means we have to provide the true structure of the data as an input, while other algorithms, like neural networks or random-forests, try to automatically find the structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "Candidacy : Since the number of features are not huge and there may be a clear margin of seperation that can be applied to the current data using SVM.\n",

    "**Answer: ** In my opinion, the most appropriate solution to this problem would be achieved using the Gradient Boosting ensemble model. At all training set sizes, the training and testing accuracies achieved with Gradient Boosting are significantly higher than those obtained when using the GuassianNB algorithm and by the more complex SVC model. Also, in terms of the Fbeta score, Gradient Boosting slightly outperforms SVC at all training set sizes and significately outperforms GaussianNB. We can also see that training and testing time is significantly higher for SVC model compared to other models. Gradient Bossting model did take little more time on training the model on the full training set compared to Gaussian NB but is still not bad at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "When weighing all of these attributes, we can conclude that Gradient Boosting is best suited for this problem. We will be able to fully utilize the entire dataset to maximize the performance in the unseen data without compromising on training and testing the speeds."

    "**Answer: ** Gradient Boosting Model (GBM):\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine  20 teams (trees). A boss at the top, then subordinates, then more  subordinates, and so on. Team members are explanatory variables. Assume,  Trees = 20 and Depth (number of members in each team) = 5. So each team  will have 5 members, and total members = 100. We give them a book to  read, and then they will have to answer 20 questions (Number of  observations in our data). Assume they have binary answers: Yes or No.  Now, we start the process. The aim of the process is to maximum correct  answers by building 20 teams having 5 members each. Any member can be a  part of more than 1 team, and any member can have more than 1 more than 1  role in same team. The member which have maximum roles is the most  important variable of our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The  process starts with a random guess of answers. Then it calculates error  ( = Actual - Predicted Answer). Next step, it build a team of 5  members, which reduces the error by maximum. Again, it calculates the  error. The second team (tree) has to reduce it further. But next team  doesn't trust its previous partner fully, so it assume that answers are  correct with x probability (learning rate). This process go on till 20  teams are build. So in the process, we have to decide, how many teams to  build (trees), members in each team(depth) and learning team, so that  error in the end is minimum. This can only be done by trial and error  method."

    "**Answer:**My predictions were almost right except for one which is marital-status. However, I was not expecting capital losses to play an important role but it appears to be another indicator of handling large investments and therefore wealth which aids the algorithm in defining a stronger and more accurate decision boundary. On the other hand, I did expect Age, hours-per-week, capital-gain and education number to be part of the driving predictive features due to the reasons mentioned in my answer to the question above."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
